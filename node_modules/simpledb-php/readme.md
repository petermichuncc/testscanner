simpleDB is a simple PHP class based framework for you to use as a foundation to connect to and query databases simply and easily. The framework is kept basic so that you can scale it up in any way you like, thus allowing you to tailor make it for your projects. Simply instantiate the simpleDB class, for example:

```php
$conn = new simpleDB($driver, $host, $db, $user, $pass);
```

Then you are able to use it's 3 methods: 
```php
- $conn->connectToDB();
- $conn->queryDB($query);
- $conn->disconnectDB();
```

## Installation

To install, there are a few methods:

**Using Git**

```php
$ git clone https://github.com/skulldev/SimpleDB
```

**Using your browser**

Visit the website and download the files simply and easily in .zip or .tar.gz format!
```
https://skulldev.github.io/SimpleDB/
```

**Or visit the github page:**

```

## Usage

### Instantiate the class

This is very simple but also 100% necessary, otherwise you won't be able to use any of the classes methods, all you need to do is:

```php
$conn = new simpleDB($driver, $host, $db, $user, $pass);
```

As you can see, there are 5 parameters, this is due to the use of PDO rather than mysqli as default:

#### $driver

This parameter tells PDO what type of database you are using, possible options to put into this parameter are:

| Supported DB's | Parameter to enter (as string value) |
|:-------------: |:-------------:|
| Cubrid | cubrid |
| FreeTDS / Microsoft SQL Server / Sybase | dblib |
| Firebird | firebird |
| IBM DB2 | ibm |
| IBM Informix Dynamic Server | informix |
| MySQL 3.x/4.x/5.x | mysql |
| Oracle Call Interface | oci |
| ODBC v3 (IBM DB2, unixODBC and win32 ODBC) | odbc |
| PostgreSQL | pgsql |
| SQLite 3 and SQLite 2 | sqllite |
| Microsoft SQL Server / SQL Azure | sqlsrv |
| 4D | 4d |

#### $host

Where is the database hosted?

Generally during development this will be 'localhost' for your local WAMP, MAMP, XAMP or so on local server.

Upon launch though, this will usually be the IP of your server.

#### $db

What is the name of the database you want to connect into?

#### $user

What is the username to access that database?

#### $pass

What is the password for the database?

### Connect to the database

Now we have instantiated our class and got our details together, we can now connect to the database, this is very simple:

```php
$conn->connectToDB();
```

Easy right?

### Querying your database

This method accepts one parameter:

$conn->queryDB($query);

Your query must be in string format.

As an example I will pretend I am using SQL, since this is the most commonplace db type to come across.

You could say something like:

```php
$conn->queryDB("
SELECT *
FROM someTable
");
```

### Disconnecting from the database

This is optional but reccomended for security.

So unless you specifically need or want a constant connection, do this after queries.

```php
$connect->disconnectDB();
```

### I have disconnected from the database, how do I reconnect to run another query?

Simple, all you need to do is run the connect method and then your query, seeing as we have already instantiated our class:

```php
$connect->connectToDB(); //connect to the db
$connect->queryDB("
SELECT *
FROM someTable 
");
```

This system of disconnecting and reconnecting also allows your PHP to be run on an event based basis, thus providing further customizability, usage options and security!

### Is there anything else I have to do before I use simpleDB?

Just one thing.

Currrently the output for queries is:

```php
if ( count($result) ) {
    foreach($result as $row) {
        print "<pre>";
        print_r($row);
        print "</pre>";
    }
} else {
    echo "No rows returned.";
}
```

You can customize the output how you see fit however, simply change these lines of code as you see fit, or just leave it as is, it is totally up to you.

As I said, this framework is designed with customizing in mind :).

### Why such a framework?

The idea of simpleDB is to be scaleable. I have made this as something for developers to take and use as a foundation for their projects. This is especially good for those who are just getting into backend development and are not sure how to connect or query databases easily. 

The framework will be updated with more security and methods in the future but these will always be scaleable and easy to alter for a user.
